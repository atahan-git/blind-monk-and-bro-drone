Go to `Scenes/Copy-paste starter room.unity` and make a copy and work there

In the scene there is `---- Important Stuff ----/_Mat Clipping Helper/AlphaClippingController`. Right click on that to Enable/Disable Alpha Clipping which will enable disable drone vision (its annoying to work on the level with it enabled)

Then you can look around to figure things out. I'll clean up more later
